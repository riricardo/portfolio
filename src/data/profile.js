    "Hi, I’m Ricardo Cardona, a detail-oriented full-stack developer based in Leixlip, Ireland. I focus on building clean, reliable web and mobile applications with an emphasis on maintainable code and thoughtful user interfaces.\nI have experience working with technologies such as React, JavaScript, Firebase, C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server, and Delphi, and I enjoy applying them to solve practical problems. From backend APIs to modern frontends, I value clarity, consistency, and long-term sustainability in the solutions I build.\nI continuously improve my skills by working on real projects, learning from challenges, and refining my approach with each iteration.",
